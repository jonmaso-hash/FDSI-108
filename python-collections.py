"""
Python Collections Comparison Activity

1. Create a list of data structures
Write down the four main Python collections:
List
Dictionary
Set
Tuple

2. Provide a syntax example 
For each collection, write a short Python code example that shows how it looks: 
List
Dictionary
Set 
Tuple

3. Analyze the characteritistcs 
Decide for reach collection: 
Is it ordered (does it keep the order of elements)?
Is it Mutable (can you change it afer createtion)?
Does it Allow Duplicates?

4. Identify the access method
Exaplain how to access elements:
List/tuple
Dictionary
Set

6. Organize the information in a table
You may create the table in your notebook(on paper) or digitally a text editor, spreadsheet, or Markdown).

 Data Structure| Syntax Example| Ordered| Mutable| Allows Duplicate| Access method
List           | [10, 20,30]  |  Yes   | Yes       |  Yes           | list[0]
Dictionary     |{key: "value"}|  yes   |  Yes      |   no           |  ["key"]
Set            |  (10,20,30)  |  No    |     no    |   no           |[0] iterate
Tuple          |  (10,20,30)  |  yes   |      no   |    yes         | tuple[0]
